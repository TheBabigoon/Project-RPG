## Worldbuilding Form: The Foundation

#### Step 1: The Core Concept (The "Elevator Pitch")

· World Name: Earth
· Genre: Adult, Fantasy, Post-Apocalyptic
· Core Concept (The "What If?"): A world where not only human but monsters start populating modern earth, leading to a society where moralities starts to fading.

#### Step 2: The Physical World (The Stage)

· Overall Climate & Geography:
  · Example: "A tidally-locked planet with a scorching hot dayside, a frozen nightside, and a narrow, habitable twilight belt."
· Map Sketch (Describe key features):
  · Major Landmarks: (e.g., The Shattered Spine Mountains, The Whispering Sea)
  · Notable Settlements: (e.g., The floating city of Aetherium, the underground hive of Deep-Root)
  · Important Natural Resources: What is abundant? What is desperately scarce?
· The "Weird" Factor: What is one strange, unnatural, or magical physical law or phenomenon in your world?
  · Example: "Gravity is 50% weaker, allowing for giant creatures and floating landmasses."

#### Step 3: Society & Culture (The People)

· Primary Culture/Faction Name:
· Government & Power:
  · Type of Government: (e.g., Monarchy, Theocracy, Corporate Oligarchy, Anarchy)
  · Who Holds Power? (e.g., The Mage-King, the Merchant's Guild, a ruling AI)

  · What does society value most? (e.g., Strength, Cunning, Piety, Innovation)
  · Are there social classes? Describe them briefly. (e.g., Nobles, Artisans, The Unnamed [lower class])
· Daily Life & Beliefs:
  · Common Customs: (e.g., A festival to honor the dead, a daily moment of silence for the fallen sun)
  · A Common Superstition: (e.g., "Whistling at night attracts the shadow-wraiths.")
  · Primary Religion/Philosophy: (e.g., Worship of the Machine God, belief in reincarnation, a philosophy of pure rationalism)

#### Step 4: Rules & Systems (How Things Work)

· Magic or Advanced Technology:
  · What is it called? (e.g., The Art, The Force, Aether-manipulation, Nanotech)
  · Source: Where does it come from? (e.g., The soul, the elements, a parallel dimension, advanced science)
  · Cost/Limitation: What does using it require? (e.g., Drains life force, requires rare components, can only be used by a certain bloodline, requires fuel)
  · What CAN'T it do? (This is crucial for creating tension)
· Economy & Trade:
  · Currency: What is used for trade? (e.g., Gold coins, digital credits, barter, favors)
  · Key Exports/Imports: What does your starting location produce, and what does it need from elsewhere?

#### Step 5: History & Conflict (The Engine of Story)

· The Major Past Event: What single event in the last 100 years most shaped the world today?
  · Example: "The God-War, which shattered the moon and flooded the coasts."
· The Current Central Conflict: What is the main problem, tension, or threat in the world right now?
  · Example: "The ruling Empress is dying without an heir, and three noble houses are vying for the throne."
· Rumors & Legends: What is one famous legend everyone knows, and one dark rumor only a few whisper about?
  · Legend: "The First King pulled the sun from the sky to warm the world."
  · Rumor: "The royal advisors are secretly vampires, sustaining the dying Empress with their blood."

## Your Starting Point: The Hometown

This is where your story or campaign will likely begin. Flesh this out in detail.

· Settlement Name:
· Location & Description: (e.g., "A dusty mining town at the foot of the Iron Tooth mountains.")
· The Leader: Who is in charge here? (e.g., The gruff Mine Foreman, the wise Village Elder, a corrupt Sheriff)
· The Heart of the Town: Where do people gather? (e.g., The Rusty Nail tavern, the communal well, the market square)
· The Town's Problem: What specific, local problem is happening here that the characters can get involved with? (This should be a small-scale version of or a problem caused by the "Central Conflict" from above).
  · Example: "Mine collapses have become frequent and strange, whispers are heard from the deepest shafts, and several miners have gone missing."
· Two Key NPCs:
  · 1. The Ally: A friendly face who can help. (e.g., "Elara, the compassionate town healer.")
  · 2. The Obstacle: Someone who stands in the way. (e.g., "Borin, the greedy mine owner who refuses to close the shafts.")
